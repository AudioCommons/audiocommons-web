title:  "The AudioCommons project has come to an end"
author: Audio Commons Consortium
---

The [H2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) funded **AudioCommons** project has officially ended on January 2019. During the last **three years**, we have carried out a huge amount of work and largely contributed to the goals of the **Audio Commons Initiative**, bringing Creative Commons audio content closer to the Creative Industries and to the public in general. Not only the original partners of the AudioCommons consortium have been involved in contributing to these goals but also other institutions, collaborators, and individuals surrounding the project have engaged in the synergies it has created. Our [report about the dissemination activities](/assets/files/AC-WP7-QMUL-D7.7%20Report%20on%20dissemination%20and%20publication%20of%20results.pdf) carried out during the AudioCommons project summarizes the impact that the project has had. We have published more than **70 research papers**, attended more than **30 academic and industry events** and developed around **20 tools, services and prototypes** (including a product released commercially and another one to be released at a later date). And there are still a number of planned publications which will be finished in the coming months. The vast majority of the research papers and the developed tools have **open licenses** that allow their reuse and further development by the community.

With the AudioCommons project being over, the continuity and growth of the Audio Commons Initiative remains subject to new funding and/or 3rd party initiatives that can **take advantage of the work weâ€™ve already done**. All the developments that happened during the project are now part of a growing ecosystem that supports Creative Commons audio. During the project we have learned a number of lessons and discussed the future growth of such an ecosystem. All this knowledge is a big contribution of the AudioCommons project and is now openly available through the project deliverables and papers that we have published. The full list of AudioCommons deliverables and publications can be found in the [materials](/materials) section of this website. Similarly, a list of tools, demonstrators and other resources can be found in the [tools](/tools) section.

**The foundations and recommendations for the future steps of an open ecosystem of content, users and tools around Creative Commons audio have now been set**. It will be great to see where all this leads in the future.
