title:  "The AudioCommons project has come to an end"
author: Frederic Font
---

The [H2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) funded **AudioCommons** project has officially been finished on January 2019. During the last **three years**, we have carried out a huge ammount of work and largely contributed to the goals of the **Audio Commons Initiative**, bringing Creative Commons audio content *deifnitely* closer to the Creative Industries and to the public in general. Not only the original partners of the Audio Commons consortium have been involved in such goals but also other institutions, collaborators and individuals sorrounding the project and engaged in the synergies it has created. Our [report on the dissemination activities](/assets/files/AC-WP7-QMUL-D7.7%20Report%20on%20dissemination%20and%20publication%20of%20results.pdf) carried out during the AudioCommons project summarizes somehow the impact that the project has had. We have published **more than 70 research papers**, attended more than **30 academic and industry events** and developed around **20 tools, services and prototypes**. The vast majority of the research papers and the developed tools have open licenses that allow their reuse and further development by the community. 

With the AudioCommons project being over, the future continuity and growth of the Audio Commons Initiative remains subject to extra funding lines or 3rd party initiatives to **take over things where we left them**. All the developments that happened during the project are now part of a growing ecosystem that supports Creative Commons audio. During the project we have learned a number of lessons and made recommendations for the future growth of an Audio Commons Ecosystem. All this knowledge is also a big contribution of the AudioCommons project and is now openly available through the project deliverables and papers that we have published. **The foundations and guides for the future steps of an eopn ecosystem of content, users and tools around Creative Commons audio have now been set**. We will continue promoting the ideas and concepts behind the Audio Commons Initiative and we'll see what awaits us in the future.
