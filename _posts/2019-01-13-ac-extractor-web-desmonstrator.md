The **Audio Commons Extractor Web Demonstrator** is a tool that allows you to search in Freesound and filter content using some of the Audio Commons descriptors for music samples developed during the Audio Commons project. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<a href="http://www.audiocommons.org/ac-audio-extractor/web_demonstrator/" target="_blank">Open the Audio Commons Extractor Web Demonstrator</a> 
</p>

You can use the provided search interface below to set the filters for your query, including **tonality** , **tempo**, **pitch**, **loop***ines*,**single-event***ness*, **brightness**, **hardness** and **depth**. Filters can be enabled and disabled by clicking on them. Note the circular knobs in the tonality, tempo and pitch filters. Use them to set the minimum **confidence** of the annotations for the returned results. The higher you set the knob (turn right), the more accurate results you should obtain.
