As part of one of our first actions within the AudioCommons project weâ€™re rolling out an online survey to gain insights into how creative users interact or wish to be able to interact with audio commons content whether e.g. samples, loops, sound effects or entire songs. 
The results will help us defining strategies and technologies to improve workflows for music artists, sound designers, audio engineers and producers.
 
The survey consists in a set of multiple choice, checkbox and free form (open ended) questions. 
It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.
You can participate in the survey by [following this link](https://goo.gl/U8mAz9).
