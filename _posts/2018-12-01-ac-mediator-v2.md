The **Audio Commons Mediator** is a central piece in the Audio Commons Ecosystem which facilitates the interconnection of all services and allows developers to access them using a unified API. This particular version of the mediator, V2, is implemented using semantic technologies and provides similar functionality to the mediator V2 but with a different API and using the [Audio Commons Ontology](/2018/07/27/audio-commons-ontology.html) to represent and process all data.

More information about the Audio Commons Mediator V2 and how to connect to the Audio Commons Ecosystem can be found in the Audio Commons documents [Deliverable 2.7](https://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP2-QMUL-D2.7%20Service%20integration%20guidelines.pdf) and [Deliverable 2.8](https://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP2-QMUL-D2.8%20Ontology%20evaluation%20report.pdf).

Note that the Audio Commons services, mediator and API are in a **prototyping** state. Performance might not be optimal and some errors and inconsistencies might appear here and there. You can report bugs and provide general feedback by opening issues in the [source code repository](https://github.com/AudioCommons/semanticMediator/issues).
