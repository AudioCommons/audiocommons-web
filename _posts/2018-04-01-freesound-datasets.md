Openly available datasets are a key factor in the advancement of sound and music computing technologies. Quite a number of audio datasets are now available but often their creation process lack of transparency and they are not completly open and sharable. Moreover, they are often not large enough for supporting current machine learning needs. These shortcomings motivated our initiative in creating **Freesound Datasets**, an online platform for the collaborative creation of open audio collections. 

We leverage Freesound (>400k sounds) as a source of open audio content.

We rely on a community to sustainably crowdsource high-quality sound annotations and to improve our platform workflows.

We follow the principles of transparency, openness, dynamic character, and sustainability.


In particular, we started the creation of **FSD**, a dataset of everyday sounds, containing thousands of audio samples from Freesound and organised following the <a href="https://research.google.com/audioset/" target="_blank">AudioSet Ontology</a>.
In the platform, we host different microtasks which enable people to contribute to the creation of the dataset. 
For intance, you can be asked to validate the precense of a specific sound category in audio samples.
