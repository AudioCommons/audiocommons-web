During the development of the Audio Commons project we have created a number of data collections of interest for research purposes. The complete list of these data collections with information about their availability and preservation policies can be found in our [Data Management Plan](https://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP1-SURREY-D1.4%20Data%20Management%20Plan.pdf). This includes 33 entreis covering a wide range of topics. What follows is a selection of those entries that can be of more general interest and are openly available. Please check the Data Management Plan for full details.

* **Requirements survey**: Responses to a survey we launched to collect user requirements for the design of AudioCommons services. This includes the responses of 600+ participants. [Available in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/832644#.XLXZYC-B1PU).
* **Tempo, key and pitch ground truth data for music samples**: Ground truth data used for the development and evaluation of the tools for the analysis of music samples (Audio Commons Audio Extractor). [Available in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/2546754#.XEcmny2ZOL4).
