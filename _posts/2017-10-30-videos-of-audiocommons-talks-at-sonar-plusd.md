Last June Audio Commons was present at **[Sónar +D](https://sonarplusd.com)**, an international conference about creativity, technology, and cultural industries that happens inside **[Sónar](https://sonar.es)** festival in Barcelona. We organized a panel with the title **"Creative Commons for the Creative Industries"** in which we  discussed about different perspectives and specific examples that provide a vision on how Creative Commons content can be used by creative industries, create economical return for content creators, and how to address specific legal aspects. You can now watch the [video of the full panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHnCXIodaXw) here. More information about the presenters can be found in the [original news entry](http://www.audiocommons.org/2017/05/22/audiocommons-presence-at-sonar-plusd-and-primavera-sound.html) announcing the panel.

In addition, Audio Commons also hosted a challenge in [Sónar Innovation Challenge](http://sic.upf.edu). The topic of the challenge was **"musical instruments for interacting with creative commons audio"**, and an [amazing team of 5 creators](http://sic.upf.edu/challenges/audiocommons/) worked hard on the challenge and came up with [**Freesound Trip**](http://labs.freesound.org/apps/freesound-trip.html), a web application for exploring Freesound Creative Commons content in a three-dimensional space and generate crazy soundscapes synced to a metronome and ready to be used as your backing music track ;) Here you can see the [video of the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9InTUjJJDk) of Freesound Trip at Sónar Innovation Challenge. You can also [play with the application](http://5.2.16.88/Freesound-Trip/).
