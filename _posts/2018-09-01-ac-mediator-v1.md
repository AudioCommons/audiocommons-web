The **Audio Commons Mediator** is the central piece in the Audio Commons Ecosystem which connects all services and allows developers to access them using a unified API. The Audio Commons Mediator implements the Audio Commons **API specification** which is a RESTful endpoint to access Audio Commons services and content. The Audio Commons mediator also manages Audio Commons user accounts and links them with 3rd party services user accounts when needed. To get started connecting to the Audio Commons Ecosystem please use the links below.

More information about the Audio Commons mediator, API and how to connect to the Audio Commons Ecosystem can be found in the Audio Commons documents [Deliverable 2.5](https://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP2-UPF-D2.5%20Service%20Integration%20Technologies.pdf) and [Deliverable 2.6](https://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP2-UPF-D2.6%20Service%20Integration%20Draft%20Guidelines.pdf).
Note that this is the first version of the Audio Commons Mediator which does not support Semantic Web requests and responses. Note also that the Audio Commons services, mediator and API are in a **prototyping** state. Performance might not be optimal and some errors and inconsistencies might appear here and there. You can report bugs and provide general feedback by opening issues in the [source code repository](http://github.com/AudioCommons/ac-mediator/issues).
