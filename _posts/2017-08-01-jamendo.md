**Jamendo** 

Jamendo is one of the biggest platforms for independent music in the world. The goal of the website is to bring an entirely free service for all music lovers to discover music, to provide the most simple ways for an artist to share its music online, and to offer a variety of music for professionals to license for commercial at a fair price. Started in 2005, it currently hosts 470,000 tracks from 35,000 unique artists, featuring 2.3 million members and 50,000 unique visitors/day (numbers from 2016). Jamendo Licensing (20,000 clients in 2014) is an extension of Jamendo, offering all the Jamendo music that is available for commercial use (use in film, TV, advertising, in-store background music) thanks to an opt-in option for all artists (see screenshot below). Jamendo Licensing has almost 200,000 tracks (40% of the whole Jamendo catalog), the ones that the Jamendo artists have chosen to add to the program. Jamendo content is made available in the [Audio Commons](https://audiocommons.org) Ecosystem.
