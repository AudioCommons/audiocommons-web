AudioTexture Free is the free version of [AudioTexture](https://lesound.io/product/audiotexture/) plugin which loads contents from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), then generate infinitely sounds, variations or loops.

A dedicated browser interface has been designed for an integrated workflow to use Freesound content with AudioTexture. You can search with filter/sorting criteria and preview right in the browser. The browser displays the most essential information about the sounds and allows double-click to directly load into AudioTexture synthesizer. AudioTexture Free will accelerate your workflow to create more content.
