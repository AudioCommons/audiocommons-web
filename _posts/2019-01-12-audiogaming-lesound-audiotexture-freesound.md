AudioTexture Free is the free version of [AudioTexture](https://lesound.io/product/audiotexture/), an audio plugin by [AudioGaming/Le Sound](https://lesound.io) which loads contents from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), then generate infinite variations of sounds and loops. A dedicated browser interface has been designed for an integrated workflow to use Freesound content with AudioTexture. You can search with filter/sorting criteria and preview right in the browser. The browser displays the most essential information about the sounds and allows double-click to directly load into AudioTexture synthesizer. AudioTexture Free will accelerate your workflow to create more content.

AudioTexture Free has been developed as part of the [AudioCommons](https://www.audiocommons.org/) project.
