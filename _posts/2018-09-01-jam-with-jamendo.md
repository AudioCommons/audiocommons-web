**Jam with Jamendo** is a web application that suggests new practice material to music learners based on their selection of chords. A prototype was developed to demonstrate the novel ways of discovering music in the Audio Commons Ecosystem that are made possible by the AC Analysis Service. More information about Jam with Jamendo can be [found here](https://www.audiocommons.org/jam/).

Jam with Jamendo brings music learners and unsigned artists together by recommending suitable songs as new and varied practice material. In this web app, users are presented with a list of songs based on their selection of chords. They can then play along with the chord transcriptions or use the audio as backing tracks for solos and improvisations. Using AI-generated transcriptions makes it trivial to grow the underlying music catalogue without human effort.
