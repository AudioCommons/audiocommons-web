We are happy to announce that after 9 months since the start of the AudioCommons project we have reached, on due time, our first milestone!
The main goals for this first milestone were the definition of requirements for handling intellectual property processes within the Creative Commons framework and the definition of a draft Audio Commons Ontology. We have just uploaded deliverables [D3.1](http://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP3-SURREY-D3.1%20Report%20on%20Rights%20Management%20requirements.pdf) and [D3.2](http://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP3-SURREY-D3.2%20Report%20on%20usage%20of%20Creative%20Commons%20licenses.pdf) which provide a description about the legal background of rights management in the audio industry and the application of the Creative Commons framework with a special emphasis on how it can handle commercial reuse of audio content. We have also uploaded deliverable [D2.2](http://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP2-QMUL-D2.2%20Draft%20Ontology%20Specification.pdf) which includes the first draft of the Audio Commons Ontology which will be used by the intelligent systems in the backbone of the Audio Commons Ecosystem.

Besides working on these two main goals we have been also doing early research on the semantic annotation of musical and non-musical audio content. Of special relevance is deliverable [D4.1](http://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP4-UPF-D4.1%20Report%20on%20the%20analysis%20and%20compilation%20of%20state-of-the-art%20methods%20for%20the%20automatic%20annotation%20of%20music%20pieces%20and%20music%20samples.pdf), which includes a report on existing techniques for automatic music annotation, and deliverable [D5.1](http://www.audiocommons.org/assets/files/AC-WP5-Surrey-D5.1%20Hierarchical%20ontology%20of%20timbral%20semantic%20descriptors.pdf), which describes a hierarchy of timbral semantic descriptors intended for annotating both musical and non-musical content.

Most of the deliverables that are produced in the project as well as scientific publications and other kinds of relevant material can be found in the [materials section](http://www.audiocommons.org/materials/) of our website.

The next milestone is scheduled for the end of April 2017, and includes the release of a prototype implementation of the Audio Commons Ecosystem. We have already started working on the different software services that will conform it and on the definition of the common API that will allow 3rd party applications to interact with Audio Commons content. We will keep you updated!
