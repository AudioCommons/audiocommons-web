# Call for Computer Music Composers and Producers


Are you a music composer, producer, sound designer who is always looking for new resources to use in your professional or educational practice?


Would you be interested in trialling new tools to integrate online audio resources licensed under Creative Commons in your workflow?


Make music with the latest tools developed by our Audio Commons project partners Waves Audio, AudioGaming and Jamendo!


We are running a study for the month of August in the qMedia Studios at Queen Mary University of London where you will be invited to:


Explore new Audio Commons web-based tools and audio content in a hands-on session.

Compose a simple musical piece inspired by the Beatles in 1 hour, only using Audio Commons content and tools. You will have access to content from Freesound, Europeana, Jamendo provided by web interfaces and plugins from Waves Audio, Audiogaming, and Jamendo. Your production will take place in our studios with either Ableton Live or Apple Logic Pro X.

Tell us about how you used the tools to produce your piece.


The study is paid Â£30 and refreshments will be available. It will be held in the qMedia studios at Queen Mary University of London. It should take less than 3 hours to complete.
